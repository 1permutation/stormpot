/**
 * BlazePool is a highly optimised {@link LifecycledResizablePool}
 * implementation that consists of a queues of Poolable instances, the access
 * to which is made faster with clever use of ThreadLocals.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Object allocation always happens in a dedicated thread, off-loading the 
 * cost of allocating the pooled objects. This should lead to reduced deviation
 * in the times it takes claim method to complete, provided the pool is not
 * depleted.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * BlazePool optimises for the case where the same threads need to claim and
 * release objects over and over again. On the other hand, if the releasing
 * thread tends to differ from the claiming thread, then the major optimisation
 * in BlazePool is defeated, and performance regresses to a slow-path that is
 * a tad slower than {@link stormpot.QueuePool}.
