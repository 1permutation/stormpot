/**
 * = The basic configuration &quot;bean&quot; class.
 *
 * Instances of this class is passed to the constructors of {@link Pool pools}
 * so that they know how big they should be, how to allocate objects and when
 * to deallocate objects.
 *
 * This class is made thread-safe by having the fields be protected by the
 * intrinsic object lock on the Config object itself. This way, pools can
 * `synchronize` on the config object to read the values out
 * atomically.
 *
 * The various set* methods are made to return the Config instance itself, so
 * that the method calls may be chained if so desired.
 * 
 * = Standardised configuration
 *
 * The contract of the Config class, and how Pools will interpret it, is within
 * the context of a so-called standardised configuration. All pool and Config
 * implementations must behave similarly in a standardised configuration.
 *
 * It is conceivable that some pool implementations will come with their own
 * sub-classes of Config, that allow greater control over the pools behaviour.
 * It is even permissible that these pool implementations may
 * deviate from the contract of the Pool interface. However, they are only
 * allowed to do so in a non-standard configuration. That is, any deviation
 * from the specified contracts must be explicitly enabled.
 * 
 * @author Chris Vest &lt;mr.chrisvest@gmail.com&gt;
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of {@link Poolable} objects that a {@link Pool} based
 * on this Config will produce.
